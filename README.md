# liri-node-app

Liri Bot similar to Iphone's Siri, however Siri interprets speech while Liri Bot interprets user-input. Liri is a command-line node app that takes in paramaters and gives the user back data. 


# ORGANIZATION 
- To get Liri running I created four different functions relative to each command Liri is able to give. To get those functions working I referenced them inside of a switch/command function. 

- Liri takes in 4 different commands. 

#INSTRUCTIONS
  
  -Follow the instructions under each command
  -there are no quotes surrounding user input 
 
 - Command 1 = "concert-this"
      - (User Input) = node liri.js concert-this <"Your Band or Artist">
                                                       
 
 - Command 2 = "spotify-this-song"
      - (User Input) = node liri.js spotify-this-song <"Your Song">
